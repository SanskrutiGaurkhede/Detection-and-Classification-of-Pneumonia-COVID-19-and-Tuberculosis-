The co-occurrence of respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, COVID-19, and tuberculosis poses significant challenges in accurate and timely diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Leveraging deep learning techniques for image analysis presents a promising avenue for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for the detection and classification of pneumonia, COVID-19, and tuberculosis from chest X-ray images.
Objectives:
Develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting pneumonia, COVID-19, and tuberculosis from chest X-ray images.
Design a classification algorithm to differentiate between the three diseases with high accuracy.
Evaluate the performance of the model on a diverse and representative dataset.
Investigate the potential of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization and robustness.# Detection-and-Classification-of-Pneumonia-COVID-19-and-Tuberculosis-
